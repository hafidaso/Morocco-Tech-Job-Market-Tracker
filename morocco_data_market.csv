 Be a foundational engineer who thrives in ambiguity and sets the technical bar. You are obsessive about solving problems with code and you live at the intersection of AI, engineering, and value creation. You are self aware enough to validate the problem behind what you build and you enjoy creating measurable customer value. You will design and ship end to end systems, partner tightly with Product, Design, Customer Success, and Sales on real customer workflows, and turn vague problems into shippable software with speed and quality.
   

  

**What You Will Do**
* Design and build scalable, secure backend services and APIs from scratch; own infra, observability, and performance for what you ship.
* Make pragmatic architectural decisions that balance speed, correctness, and long\\-term maintainability.
* Partner with Product, Design, CS, and Sales to power high\\-value customer workflows and close the learn–ship loop
* Ship AI\\-assisted features and internal agents using prompt patterns, structured outputs, function calling, retrieval, and vector stores; measure quality with evaluation harnesses.
* Build and maintain integrations between our Grow platform and third\\-party enterprise apps
* Lead technical design reviews; contribute to code and production\\-readiness reviews.
* Mentor less\\-experienced engineers through pairing, clear examples, and actionable feedback.
* Debug and resolve production issues across the stack with strong observability and crisp runbooks.
* Build with security, privacy, and compliance in mind for regulated financial and insurance data.
* Wear many hats—architect, builder, product partner, mentor—and disagree\\-and\\-commit to keep the team moving.


**What You Will Own**
* Service quality: performance, reliability, security, and cost awareness.
* Delivery cadence: fast CI/CD, robust automated tests, incremental and reversible changes.
* Engineering standards: DDD, clean OOP, code quality, and pragmatic documentation.
* Visibility: self\\-serve dashboards for service health, latency, errors, and business KPIs.


**You might be a fit if you have**
* 5\\+ years shipping production systems end\\-to\\-end, ideally with Laravel and Vue.
* Strong system design for data\\-intensive, distributed, or event\\-driven systems.
* Solid grasp of CI/CD and TDD with automated test suites and pipelines.
* Working knowledge of Domain\\-Driven Design and clean OOP principles.
* Hands\\-on mindset and high ownership; you learn what you need to get the job done and share that knowledge.
* You tinker with AI weekly—LLMs, agents, evals, or automation—and bring those wins into your workflow.
* Clear communication, evidence\\-based decisions, and comfort operating in high\\-velocity environments.


**Our tech stack**
**Familiarity Is a Plus, Not a Gate**
* Backend: PHP, Laravel
* Frontend: Vue, React Native, Electron
* Data/DB: MySQL, MS SQL
* Cloud/Infra: AWS and GCP (nice to have)
* Platform/Tooling: Docker, Kubernetes (nice to have)
* Patterns: APIs, webhooks, eventing, observability, DDD, clean architecture


**What Success Looks Like In 6 Months**
* Ship customer features end to end. Take a problem from brief to production and adoption, partnering with Design and PM.
* Own a customer integration. Lead scoping, backend build, deployment, and QA for one real client integration.
* Improve reliability and quality. Reduce defects and tackle a couple of clear performance hotspots on a key service.
* Use AI to boost leverage. Put 2 to 3 lightweight agents or automations in place that save the team real hours.


**Why join us**
* Be a core builder in an ambitious, AI\\-native InsurTech powering modern insurance infrastructure across Africa and the Middle East.
* Work directly with leadership, ship weekly, and see your work move revenue, reliability, and customer outcomes.
* High ownership, high learning rate, and a culture that values speed with judgment.


**How We Work**
* Passionate Work: Enjoy the work, set ambitious goals, and consistently exceed expectations
* Relentless Growth: Stay curious, set bold targets, and adapt quickly to learn
* Empowered Action: Own outcomes, take initiative, and communicate with clarity
* Sense of Urgency: Deliver fast with judgment, stay agile, and prioritize high impact work

 At The Flex, we believe renting a home should be instant, intelligent, and effortless — as seamless as tapping a button.
   

  

 Our vision: a world where anyone can live anywhere, without friction or borders.
   

  

 Powered by
 **Base360\\.ai** 
 , our proprietary automation platform, we’re building the operating system of modern rentals — linking property data, orchestrating operations, and powering the intelligent systems behind every stay, in every city.
   

  

 We’re looking for a Software Engineer who loves building automation at scale — someone excited by the intersection of systems, AI, and real\\-world impact.
   

  

 If you’re driven by elegant engineering and meaningful product impact, this is your chance to help reshape global living.
   

  

 💡 What You’ll Build
   

  

 You’ll work on the foundation of The Flex platform — building and scaling the systems behind instant bookings, automated logistics, smart access, and predictive operations.
   

  

 You’ll take messy real\\-world processes and turn them into clean, automated, production\\-grade software that powers thousands of stays around the world.
   

  

 Your work will directly influence how people live, travel, and experience true flexibility across borders.
   

  

 ⚙️ Your Mission
   

  

**Build Core Services** 
 — Develop fast, reliable APIs and backend workflows that support global bookings, payments, and operations.
   

  

**Automate the Everyday** 
 — Craft microservices and serverless systems that eliminate repetitive tasks and enable fully automated stays.
   

  

**Connect the Ecosystem** 
 — Build integrations between Base360\\.ai and partners like Airbnb, Stripe, Twilio, and Hostaway.
   

  

**Engineer for Scale** 
 — Design fault\\-tolerant, event\\-driven systems that process millions of real\\-time events across countries.
   

  

**Work Across Teams** 
 — Collaborate with product, data, operations, and engineering to bring automation from idea → code → real\\-world execution.
   

  

**Ship Fast, Improve Faster** 
 — Prototype, iterate, measure, and scale what delivers impact.
   

  

 🧠 You’re a Great Fit If You Have
   

  

* Experience with Node.js, React, or Python (FastAPI).
* Familiarity with AWS (especially serverless) and API\\-driven development.
* Hands\\-on experience with databases, microservices, or distributed systems.
* A passion for automation, AI\\-driven systems, and real\\-world problem solving.
* A builder’s mindset — pragmatic, fast, clean, and impact\\-focused.
* A bias toward action — you solve problems by shipping, not talking.


 🌍 Why You’ll Love It Here
   

  

**Real Influence** 
 — Your software will automate complex operations and power thousands of stays worldwide.
   

  

**A Global Vision, A Small Team** 
 — High ownership, zero bureaucracy, and the chance to build industry\\-defining systems.
   

  

**Autonomy \\& Creativity** 
 — Freedom to make big decisions, experiment, and shape the technical direction.
   

  

**Performance\\-Based Rewards** 
 — Competitive compensation and real upside for exceptional contributors.

Tu seras le maillon essentiel pour :


Administrer les clusters Kubernetes qu’ils soient managés (AKS, EKS, GKE) ou non :


* Déployer et configurer un cluster Kubernetes : le service etcd, les master et worker nodes, la mise en place d'une communication sécurisée entre eux, la gestion des certificats, l’intégration d’une container registry, la configuration des composants de base (CNI, CRI, Storage Class, Cluster Roles ...) et de la sécurité (hardening)
* Automatiser leur déploiement par l’utilisation des outils idoines : kubeadm, kops (EKS, GKE), kubespray (VM, bare metal) et les outils des distributions Kubernetes tels Rancher et Openshift
* Allouer et gérer les ressources du cluster, telles la CPU, la mémoire, le stockage, pour garantir des performances optimales des applications
* Utiliser les objets Kubernetes tels que les déploiements, les services et les pods pour déployer et gérer des applications conteneurisées dans le cluster
* Mettre à l'échelle par l’ajustement dynamique du nombre de réplicas des applications en fonction de la charge pour garantir une utilisation efficace des ressources.
* Gérer les mises à jour du cluster, des nœuds, et des applications de manière transparente tout en assurant une disponibilité continue

* Mettre en place les outils de surveillance pour suivre les performances du cluster, détecter les erreurs et les pannes, et collecter des métriques pour l'analyse (Prometheus, Grafana …).
* Mettre en place des mécanismes de sauvegarde des données des applications et les éléments de configurations du cluster ainsi que des procédures de restauration en cas de défaillance
* Collecter et analyser les journaux (logs) des conteneurs et des composants du cluster pour le dépannage et la sécurité
* Identifier et résoudre les goulots d'étranglement, ajuster les configurations, et optimiser les performances globales du cluster
* Diagnostiquer et résoudre les problèmes liés au cluster, aux applications et aux conteneurs
* Planifier et mettre en œuvre des stratégies d'évolutivité pour faire face à l'augmentation des charges de travail
* S’inscrire dans une démarche DevSecOps pour gérer les versions de code, créer, stocker et scanner les images conteneurs et automatiser le déploiement des composants et applications en adoptant pourquoi pas GitOps

Apporter une expertise sur Kubernetes et son écosystème :


* Participer à l'adoption de Kubernetes, en tenant compte des exigences de l'entreprise et des meilleures pratiques
* Fournir un support aux équipes internes (référent, formation, coaching), incluant la mise à disposition de documentation détaillée sur l'architecture et la gestion du cluster
* Travailler en étroite collaboration avec les équipes de développement, d'exploitation et autres parties prenantes pour assurer un déploiement réussi et une gestion continue du cluster
* Être prêt à intervenir en support d’escalade et en cas d'incidents critiques par la mise en œuvre des plans d'urgence et des procédures de récupération

 **What we need…**


We’re hiring a **AI Tech Product Manager** to **rapidly prototype and validate** AI\\-powered product ideas, then **handover to ML Engineering** for industrialization. You’ll pair a product mindset with **hands\\-on Python**, **data‑centric ML**, and **LLM‑centric prototyping** (prompting via APIs, chaining treatments, and building simple user interfaces for user testing) to turn promising concepts into testable, value‑proven prototypes—fast.
  

  

You’ll collaborate closely with Product Managers and Designers, and work with ML Engineers, our AI/ML Architect, and AI/ML Researcher to bring the right ideas to life.

 **What you'll do...**

* **Scope opportunities** with PMs and Designers; frame problems and success criteria before solutioning.
* **Prototype quickly** using **two equally important approaches**:
	+ **LLM‑centric prototyping**: prompt LLMs via API, chain treatments/tools/agents, and **develop simple user interfaces** to enable rapid **user testing** and feedback loops.
	+ **Data‑centric ML in Python**: feature engineering, dataset curation, model selection, training, evaluation, and error analysis to validate feasibility and impact beyond “just calling an API.”
* **Assess feasibility \\& value** (technical \\+ product), run lightweight experiments, and capture learnings.
* **Translate wins into briefs \\& delivery plans** and **handover to ML Engineers** for productionization; partner through design/QA.
* **Track impact** post‑launch with the product team (adoption, quality, and business KPIs).

  

**What you have (must haves)...**

* Strong **Python** and ML foundations; able to build workable prototypes (NumPy/pandas/scikit‑learn; PyTorch a plus).
* Proven **feature engineering** and **data‑centric ML** skills (problem decomposition, robust evaluation, error analysis).
* Equally strong **LLM prototyping** skills: **prompting via APIs**, **tool/agent orchestration and chaining**, and **building simple UIs** (e.g., lightweight web apps or internal panels) for user testing.
* Experience with **no‑code/workflow tools** (e.g., n8n) to accelerate experiments; solid prompt/agent design.
* Product mindset: ability to frame problems, run experiments, and communicate clearly with technical and non‑technical partners.
* Excellent **English** communication; proactive, self‑organized **remote** collaborator

Since 2009, we’ve helped people find and book events across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait. We’re based in Dubai and work with concerts, sports, attractions, and big brand shows – from local venues to major festivals.


We already have a 20\\+ person marketing team covering design, video, CRM, social media, and ads. But now we’re ready to take our B2B marketing to the next level — and we need someone to lead the way.

**Your Role:** You’ll be the person responsible for all things B2B marketing: lead generation, product campaigns, content, reporting, and internal coordination.


This is a hands\\-on role. You’ll be setting direction and executing — writing briefs, managing timelines, launching campaigns, and improving how we work.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Use AI tools (like ChatGPT) for copy, content ideas, and reporting.
* Use n8n or similar to automate ops: lead routing, notifications, etc.
* Build reports with the Data team to track what’s working — and what’s not.

Create simple dashboards to show campaign lead revenue.  
* 

**Requirements**

* You have 2–3 years of B2B marketing or demand generation experience.
* You’re confident with HubSpot or a similar CRM.
* You’ve worked closely with sales teams and understand what makes a lead “qualified.”
* You’re organized and can manage content and campaigns from A to Z.

* 

**Bonus Points:**

* Experience with events, SaaS, or CRM tools.
* You’ve built flows in n8n, Zapier, or Make.
* You know basic analytics (GA4, Looker, Data Studio, etc.).
* You enjoy async work and don’t need to be micromanaged.

You’re a fan of good marketing and clean design.  
* 

**Benefits**

* Creative Freedom: We value innovation and fresh ideas—no micromanagement, just results\\-driven creativity.
* Fast Decision\\-Making: Enjoy an agile work environment without corporate bureaucracy.
